# DOWO Digital Fork v1.1.0-DD

This is a fork of v1.1.0 (York UK Hosting Fork) created by DOWO Digital. The fork
implements the following:

1. Upgrade of Go Cardless to 0.4.2

Installation:

The contents of GoCardless_WHMCS directory needs to be copied to the
/modules/gateway directory.

#Important

The gocardless_hook.php file in the gocardless subdirectory should be
moved to /includes/hooks and the two parameters modified as required.

v6 compatibility - It has not been tested but it uses init.php and does
not use any templates so will hopefully work. If you do test let me
know the outcome - github@yorkukhosting.com.

Config at gocardless.com...

Locate 'URI Settings' then populate 'Redirect URI' and 'WebHook URI'.

e.g. Redirect URI = https://www.example.com/modules/gateways/gocardless/redirect.php
e.g. WebHook URI = https://www.example.com/modules/gateways/gocardless/callback.php

This fork is provided without any warranty implied or otherwise. Test in
a development environment before using.

# Announcement
